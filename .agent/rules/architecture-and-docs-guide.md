## Architecture Documentation
1) **Consult Architecture:** Always review `ARCHITECTURE.md` before starting implementation.
2) **Implement Task:** Implement the required changes based on the request.
3) **Update Architecture:** Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if the changes impact the design. Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it doesn't exist.
4) **Current State Only:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` MUST ONLY consist of the current state of the codebase. It MUST NOT include plans for future implementations unless necessary to describe the reason behind a selected solution.
